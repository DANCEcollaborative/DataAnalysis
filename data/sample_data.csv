462,2867876351,"Comfortable, cost effective, sleeps cool, no odor, supportive.","I have slept on many mattresses in my life, spring and memory foam. I spent nearly a month looking at memory foam mattresses as they are not all the same. What I liked about this one is it had 3 inches of memory foam and multi layers of comfort and support foam. When I looked at other similar priced ones they only had 2 inches of memory foam, so this grabbed me right away at 3 inches. I would say that this is much nicer to sleep on than an Endy or Casper, considering the price point you can't go wrong. I'm not a light weight person, so getting the 10 inch he mattress was perfect and supports me easily. I look forward to going to bed now that I have a mattress that is so comfortable! When I opened the bag the bed inflated very quickly, all of the mattress was level and flat with no dips or bends at the sides and no gross smell like you get with a lot of these kinds of mattresses. It also allows my dog to jump on and off the bed at night to not wake me. The best thing is it doesn't sleep hot, so if you get warm during the night this mattress is not going to make you warmer. The cover on the mattress is plush and in the box you get a thank you card from the company, you also get some none marked cards to give people for birthdays or holiday occasions which is a nice touch. I really believe this mattress was far beyond my expectations and anyone doing their research can stop here, believe me I did plenty before getting this one. The only down side is its shipped by Purolator so do not expect it to be getting there on time, I had quite the argument with them when they said they misplaced a mattress..... A mattress. The manager soon made sure it was found and put on the next truck but if I hadn't caused quite the stink I'd probably still be waiting.",,,,100,,consumer,2019-07-06 00:00:00,2019-07-15 05:22:59,2019-07-15 05:20:22,"{'Id': '162622464', 'Url': 'https://www.amazon.ca/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFLUTKOBKPC5ZH7GNKSGPQNSZ4OA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8', 'UserName': 'Samantha', 'Name': '', 'AvatarUrl': '', 'Location': '', 'Age': '', 'Sex': '', 'Description': ''}",https://www.amazon.ca/Ultima-Comfort-Memory-Mattress-Queen/product-reviews/B006LAK9A4/ref=sr_1_80?sortBy=bySubmissionDateDescending&reviewerType=all_reviews&formatType=current_format,,,English,"{'Id': '559', 'ExtKey': '5706b9552', 'Name': 'amazon.ca', 'SiteUrl': 'http://www.amazon.ca', 'Country': 'CA'}","{'Item': 'Zinus AZ-FMS-10Q Ultima Comfort Memory Foam 10 Inch Mattress, Queen', 'Category': '', 'Id': '74247077', 'CategoryUrl': '', 'ItemUrl': 'https://www.amazon.ca/Ultima-Comfort-Memory-Mattress-Queen/dp/B006LAK9A4/ref=sr_1_80?s=kitchen&ie=UTF8&qid=1532633599&sr=1-80'}",1773,351,Casper,1.0,1.0
897,2820811731,I love Serta!,"I love my new Serta Mattress! I come from another country where Serta mattresses are imported and compete really well with the good quality national brands. This is how I know about Serta. Being in the United States and with the idea to buy a good mattress, I did not have doubt to choose one Serta. I have always liked the innersprings mattresses so I found Serta combines them with memory foam in some of the mattresses (hybrid) plus the gel memory foam. Serta means to me Quality and Comfort. Buy a Serta mattress is to have invested in my physical, mental and emotional health because if I can sleep deeply and rest well, I will wake up recharged, ready to begin the day full of energy. I was sleeping on an old mattress and I had back pain in my lower area, besides to sweat during the night even in winter. With my new mattress (Serta) it is past history. If your are planning to buy a mattress, I really recomend you to buy a Serta Mattress. I am happy and in love with my Serta Mattress!",,,,100,,consumer,2018-07-06 00:00:00,2019-05-31 17:40:43,2019-05-31 17:33:54,"{'Id': '337018219', 'Url': '', 'UserName': 'SandraB1530838314', 'Name': '', 'AvatarUrl': '', 'Location': '', 'Age': '', 'Sex': '', 'Description': ''}",https://www.walmart.com/ip/Serta-iComfort-Blue-Fusion-100-Firm-Mattress/404865053,,,English,"{'Id': '47', 'ExtKey': '490a81212', 'Name': 'walmart.com', 'SiteUrl': 'http://www.walmart.com', 'Country': 'US'}","{'Item': 'Serta iComfort Blue Fusion 100 Firm Queen Mattress', 'Category': 'Home >\n       /Furniture >\n       /Bedroom Furniture >\n       /Mattresses & Accessories >\n       /Memory Foam Mattresses >', 'Id': '76722354', 'CategoryUrl': 'https://www.walmart.com/cp/414609', 'ItemUrl': 'https://www.walmart.com/ip/Serta-iComfort-Blue-Fusion-100-Firm-Mattress/404865053'}",995,188,Serta,1.0,1.0
1863,2762973158,Changed my entire sleep experience!,"I've been a memory foam bed person since the early 2000's.... my first ""full price new mattress"" out of college was a Serta memory foam bed in full size. It wasn't cheap, and it was the best I've ever had.  Since then I've moved, and have gone up in bed size now to queen. What I have now is not a Serta, unfortunately, and while it was great for a couple years, started to get a bit ""too soft"" in the middle, and sort of turned into a crevice in the middle.  I did something kind of unexpected with this topper and my old mattress: I flipped the old mattress on it's top-- it was foam, and firmer foam on the bottom, so starting with a firmer foundation and putting this on top essentially gave me a ""new bed!""  I am very pleased that the ""new bed scent"" really did go away in fewer than 24 hours, it is perfectly made with no rips, tears or wrongly cut edges, and the bed cover that it came with really helps hold it in the perfect place.  This topper is the traditional ""visco feel"" memory foam that has more memory effect than your typical topper. It is comfortable, and throughout the night feels firmer than typical toppers. Firmer, but not uncomfortable. As soon as you settle into a new spot your warmth softens the foam and you sink in-- just a tiny bit-- to comfort.  When I buy a new mattress again in the future it probably will be a Serta again. Until then, this went a long way to making my rest a lot more restful, and with minimal effort on my part.",,,,100,,consumer,2018-03-24 00:00:00,2019-05-09 04:39:34,2019-05-09 04:38:28,"{'Id': '252042055', 'Url': 'https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AHITDBJCF4LZ3VGQVSAJIP6AAXHA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8', 'UserName': 'THATCHMAN1', 'Name': '', 'AvatarUrl': '', 'Location': '', 'Age': '', 'Sex': '', 'Description': ''}",https://www.amazon.com/Serta-Lasting-Gel-Infused-Memory-Mattress/product-reviews/B0784FTWQH/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_3?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=3&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=bySubmissionDateDescending&formatType=current_format,,,English,"{'Id': '19', 'ExtKey': '4463f0112', 'Name': 'amazon.com category', 'SiteUrl': 'http://www.amazon.com', 'Country': 'US'}","{'Item': 'Serta 3"" Lasting Dream Plus Gel-Infused Memory Foam Mattress Topper,...', 'Category': '', 'Id': '74847905', 'CategoryUrl': 'https://www.amazon.com/Mattresses-Box-Springs-Bedroom-Furniture/s?i=garden&rh=n%3A3732961&lo=grid&page=13&qid=1567221801&ref=sr_pg_12', 'ItemUrl': 'https://www.amazon.com/Serta-Lasting-Gel-Infused-Memory-Mattress/dp/B0784FTWQH/ref=sr_1_292'}",1465,282,Serta,1.0,
3443,2728617258,,"This was my easiest purchase of a mattress- EVER. No walking around stores doing the mattress version of ""kicking the tires"". Then waiting around for the delivery which can be a 4 hour wait or an all day wait. If you're not happy with what you buy you have to check with customer service to see if they'll take it back. With Tuft & Needle there's none of that. I bought the size mattress I wanted- online- for much less than I've paid for almost all the mattresses I've bought in my life. I have 100 days to decide if I like it. If I don't I contact Tuft & Needle and make arrangements to donate the mattress to a local organization that will pick it up. I send the receipt to Tuft & Needle and they refund my money. BUT I like it, so with little effort on my part- cutting the plastic off the mattress when it's delivered to my door- in a size easy to move around- a box 4 feet high and 19 inches square- then as air returns to the mattress and it becomes a queen size mattress I just place it on the box spring and my job is done. Comfortable mattress at a very affordable price.",,,,100,,consumer,2015-09-08 00:00:00,2019-04-10 17:40:34,2019-04-10 17:40:16,"{'Id': '1036921', 'Url': 'https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AHSYCQODYCVK3VRCKVMPM2YQOV5Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8', 'UserName': 'chief', 'Name': '', 'AvatarUrl': '', 'Location': '', 'Age': '', 'Sex': '', 'Description': ''}",https://www.amazon.com/Tuft-Needle-Certi-PUR-Certified-Warranty/product-reviews/B00QBZ265U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_365?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=365&reviewerType=all_reviews&sortBy=bySubmissionDateDescending&formatType=current_format,,,English,"{'Id': '19', 'ExtKey': '4463f0112', 'Name': 'amazon.com', 'SiteUrl': 'http://www.amazon.com', 'Country': 'US'}","{'Item': 'Tuft & Needle Queen Mattress, Bed in a Box, T&N Adaptive Foam, Sleeps...', 'Category': '', 'Id': '73564966', 'CategoryUrl': 'https://www.amazon.com/Mattresses-Box-Springs/b?ie=UTF8&node=3732961&ref_=sd_allcat_home_mattresses', 'ItemUrl': 'https://www.amazon.com/Tuft-Needle-Mattress-Certi-PUR-Certified/dp/B00QBZ265U'}",1081,213,Tuft & Needle,1.0,
6127,2957349973,Super comfortable without added warmth,"I am very pleased with this Casper Mattress topper as it truly gives my old mattress a new level of comfort. My mattress is a pillow top style but over the years the top layer has flattened and lost it's buoyancy. This topper by Casper has transformed my bed into a place where I'm getting a great night's sleep on now one of the best beds I've slept in! I'll start with it's design which is different then other toppers I've looked into. It's enclosed in a really nice zippered case that has material on the bottom that helps it stay in place and prevent it from moving around off the mattress. The upper material is substantial and a lovely grey color with a quality zipper. Set up was easy, just unroll and you're ready to go. I was able to fit my regular deep corner sheets and cotton mattress pad over everything once the Casper was in place. I'm not an expert on foam but apparently Casper is. Whatever technology Casper uses in their foam filling surely rises to the occasion. I didn't feel any extra heat from the topper and found I slept more soundly with less tossing and turning. My body felt cradled without that sinking in feeling. It also seems to be keeping it's shape after a good night's sleep. The only reason I'm taking off one star is because there is a ridge on one side of the topper and I tried to flatten it out with my sheets. I think it may have been a slight defect in which the inside foam was cut slightly larger then the case so it's buckled. Also, there is a slight odor but that is dissipating with time and almost all gone. Still, this Casper Mattress topper is one that I can and will recommend to anyone who wants a more comfortable and restful night's sleep. I've posted some photos and hope they along with my experience helps you out a bit with your decision. Thank you.",,,,80,,consumer,2019-09-20 00:00:00,2019-09-23 14:59:43,2019-09-23 14:50:46,"{'Id': '250037879', 'Url': 'https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AEVICAPFFUAG22APKGF5ORLXLENA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8', 'UserName': 'Forever Geralyn', 'Name': '', 'AvatarUrl': '', 'Location': '', 'Age': '', 'Sex': '', 'Description': ''}",https://www.amazon.com/Casper-Sleep-Mattress-Topper-Queen/product-reviews/B07WK42CD5/ref=sr_1_240?sortBy=bySubmissionDateDescending&reviewerType=all_reviews&formatType=current_format,,,English,"{'Id': '19', 'ExtKey': '4463f0112', 'Name': 'amazon.com', 'SiteUrl': 'http://www.amazon.com', 'Country': 'US'}","{'Item': 'Casper Sleep Foam Mattress Topper, Queen', 'Category': '', 'Id': '80857207', 'CategoryUrl': 'https://www.amazon.com/Mattresses-Box-Springs-Bedroom-Furniture/s?i=garden&rh=n%3A3732961&page=14&qid=1571263719&ref=sr_pg_13', 'ItemUrl': 'https://www.amazon.com/Casper-Sleep-Mattress-Topper-Queen/dp/B07WK42CD5/ref=sr_1_332'}",1808,339,Casper,1.0,1.0
